<a id="about"><h2>About</h2></a>
<p>RuneQuest Encounter Generator is a tool for generating random NPC's and monsters for RuneQuest 6.</p>
<p>One of the fundamental principles of the tool is, that the creation of the content - the NPC/monsters 
specifications and templates - is created by the community. Anybody can create a new template, that
other users can later use to generate NPC's/monsters.</p>
